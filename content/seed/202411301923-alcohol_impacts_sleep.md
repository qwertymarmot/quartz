  ## Notes
 - I have found that when I consume the alcohol content in one regular beer my sleep tends to be impacted negatively. The metrics Iâ€™ve noticed are HRV and percentage of different stages of sleep (i.e. Deep, REM).
 - When I made the switch to non alcoholic beer I noticed that the negative factors disappeared.
