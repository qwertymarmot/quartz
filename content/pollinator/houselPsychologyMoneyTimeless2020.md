## Notes

-   What do I want to get out of this book?
    -   I hope to learn tactics to help me to get where I want to be financially
    -   Tactics to get my money to work for me


### Chapter 1: No Ones Crazy

-   Patience with money is important. Time can compound your money
-   Financial skills are a soft skill and can be learned or enhanced
-   Finance is guided by individual behaviors
-   We all have different experiences with money that have shaped how we look at money and personal finance. That is why when you look at two different people they have completely different thoughts on money.
-   If you were born in 1970 the stock market incresed 10 fold in your formative years. If you were born in 1950 the stock market barely moved in your teens and 20s


### Chapter 2: Luck &amp; Risk

-   We cannot assume that 100% of outcomes are due to effort and decisions because risk and luck exist
-   Avoid the outliers when looking for advice. focus on the broader and repeating patterns that occur and cannot be associated with luck.


### Chapter 3: Never Enough

-   In order to be successful with money we need to have a sense of "[Enough]({{< relref "../sapling/20240417092843-enough.md" >}})". Withou enough the goal post will keep moving. There is always someone who has more that we can compare ourselves to. There is always another step on the ladder. Endless pursuit and lifestytle creep makes no amount of money feel like enough.


### Chapter 4: Confounding Compounding

-   [Compounding Interest]({{< relref "../sapling/20240417093042-compounding_interest.md" >}}) is the magic sauce to investing which means you have to be willing to play the long game with your money to see it through.


### Chapter 5: Getting Wealthy vs Staying Wealthy

-   Patience again is key. It can be tempting to invest in a bunch of booming stocks in a [Bull Market]({{< relref "../sapling/20240417093213-bull_market.md" >}}). but during a [Bear Market]({{< relref "../sapling/20240417093232-bear_market.md" >}}) you lose it all. It is important to invest conservatively and plan for a margin of safety. Let money sit for long periods of time.
