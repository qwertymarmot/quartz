## What I want to get out of this book {#what-i-want-to-get-out-of-this-book}

-   I want to find tactics to bypass procrastination
-   I want to learn more about creating a dopamine reward system
-   I want to learn more about pursuing purpose


## Introduction {#introduction}

-   Success doesn't require large actions. Instead it is more common from small actions that you take every single day.
-   Burn your boats. When you commit to something that you truly value then make then make it so that there isn't a way to chicken out.


## Part 1: Why you're not taking action {#part-1-why-you-re-not-taking-action}

-   What are you scared of and how is it preventing you from taking any action?
-   How do we get past those fears?


### Chapter 1: Fear {#chapter-1-fear}

-   We develop fears that are driven by things and experiences that we have never had, but are instead impart on us by friends, family or society.


#### Which fears are real, and which are imagined? {#which-fears-are-real-and-which-are-imagined}

-   Humans are born with only two fears. The fear of falling and the fear of loud noises
-   Inability to take action can be traced back to one of five fears;
    -   Fear of failure
    -   Fear of rejection
    -   Fear of success
    -   Fear of being a fraud
    -   Fear of abandonment


#### The Two Types of Fear {#the-two-types-of-fear}

-   Fear is a defense mechanism
-   Primal fears
    -   Primal fears are the instinctual fears that help keep us alive.
-   Instinctual fears are the ones that we develop from the list above when the amygdala doesn't have anything else to be afraid of.

> Our brains and bodies react the same way to intellectual fears as they do to primal fears.
