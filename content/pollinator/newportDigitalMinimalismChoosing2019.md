## What I want to get from this book {#what-i-want-to-get-from-this-book}

-   Tactics to embrace digital minimalism.
-   Motivation to keep chipping away at my phone time.


## Introduction {#introduction}

-   Everyone is mentally drained by all the content that is consistently available both negative and positive.
-   We need a philosophy for technology use that is rooted in our core values. This philosophy is something we can turn to when trying to determine what tools to use.
-   Much how minimalism focuses on minimizing the impact of things in our life, digital minimalism takes a similar approach to technology.


## Part 1 Foundations {#part-1-foundations}


### Chapter 1 A Lopsided Arms Race {#chapter-1-a-lopsided-arms-race}

-   There are good things about our apps and phone use but it is when we cannot disconnect that they become a problem.
-   Smart phones and apps are designed to operate like “slot machines” where we are enticed to keep playing to see what we can win.
-   Technology addiction is driven by intermittent positive reinforcement and the drive for social approval.
-   Irregular rewards release more dopamine than those given in a known pattern.
-   The fundamental use of social media could continue without the like buttons which provide the intermittent reinforcement.
-   Social approval is met through interaction with messages and a sense of urgency that comes with them. Likewise with tagging.


### Chapter 2 Digital Minimalism {#chapter-2-digital-minimalism}

-   A maximalist approaches technology where any potential for benefit is enough to pursue it.
-   A minimalist looks for technology uses where it aligns or contributes to a core value and is the best option available.


#### The Principles of Digital Minimalism {#the-principles-of-digital-minimalism}

-   1. Clutter is Costly
    -   Cluttering our time with devices and apps creates a negative cost that overwhelms the benefits gained
-   2. Optimization is important
    -   Decide the how in regard to technology use to support your values.
-   3. Intentionality is satisfying
    -   Purposeful interaction with technology creates a sense of satisfaction.


#### An argument for Principle #1: Thoreau’s Economics {#an-argument-for-principle-1-thoreau-s-economics}

-   What are the costs of the lives we live when entrapped by technology? Is the cost worth it?
-   Standard thought is that the positives gained through technology and social media must be maximized to create the potential for connection. However this thought doesn’t consider the consequences of immersing ourselves into these technologies.


#### An argument for Principle #2: The return curve {#an-argument-for-principle-2-the-return-curve}

-   Technology use follows a diminishing returns curve. There is an important point where that value added does not increase to the same rate as use does.
-   We have to optimize our processes for consumption to maximize value


#### An Argument for Principle #3: The Lessons of the Amish Hacker {#an-argument-for-principle-3-the-lessons-of-the-amish-hacker}

-   The Amish and Mennonites look at technology that adds value to them and their communities. If a technology is determined to have more positive value than negative then it is embraced.


#### A New Look at Old Advice {#a-new-look-at-old-advice}


### Chapter 3: The Digital Declutter {#chapter-3-the-digital-declutter}

-   Inertia to move toward digital minimalism is lower if you do it slowly.
-   A rapid transformation that is executed with conviction is more likely to stick
-   Determine what you will replace the technology you give up with to avoid boredom and anxiety.
-   Temporary detoxes are weaker conviction and easier to give up on


#### Step #1: Define your Technology Rules {#step-1-define-your-technology-rules}

-   Determine which technology is optional in your life
-   Determine if dropping a technology would be an inconvenience or critical. Don’t mix the two
-   Create a set of operating procedures for how and when you will interact with critical technology rather than allowing for free reign


#### Step 2: Take a Thirty Day Break {#step-2-take-a-thirty-day-break}

-   Take 30 days without the optional technologies in your life.
-   The first few days are likely to be difficult due to the addiction we have formed to the distractions.
-   Before the end of the 30 days you should identify high quality alternatives to the distracting technologies.


#### Step 3: Reintroduce Technology {#step-3-reintroduce-technology}

-   “the digital minimalist deploys technology to serve the things they find most important in their life.”
-   Determine what technology to reintroduce based on its support of the things you value.
-   Second determine if the technology is the most robust option for supporting that value or if there might be alternatives.
-   Last determine how to use the technology going forward to maximize value and minimize harm.


## Part 2: Practices {#part-2-practices}


### Chapter 4: Spend Time Alone {#chapter-4-spend-time-alone}


#### When Solitude Saved the Nation {#when-solitude-saved-the-nation}


#### The Value of Solitude {#the-value-of-solitude}

-   Solitude - the subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds.
-   Solitude does not have to be hard to achieve
-   Solitude can help you become more fond of close personal relationships


#### Solitude Deprivation {#solitude-deprivation}

-   The iPod was one of the first steps toward depriving ourselves of solitude. It provided a background soundtrack that could always be available when things got quiet.
-   The iPhone provided even greater deprivation because of the ability to quickly glance at apps during most situations when boredom started to arise.
-   Science has seen a sharp increase in anxiety related mental health issues shortly after it became common ground to own a smartphone. This is especially so in the generations that grew up with access to tablets, phones and constant internet access.


#### The Connected Cabin {#the-connected-cabin}

-   It is possible to find solitude in a busy town or home. You just need to balance bouts of solitude with bouts of connection.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Practices to get more solitude

    -   Leave your phone behind.
    -   Taking long walks (like hours long)
    -   Write letters to yourself


### Chapter 5: Don’t Click Like {#chapter-5-don-t-click-like}


#### The Social Animal {#the-social-animal}

-   According to studies our default mental state rests on our social life.
-   Social apps provide us with access to a fast food version of social life that allows us to fill the downtime of our default mental states.


#### The Social Media Paradox {#the-social-media-paradox}

-   Real world interactions are better for our well being.
-   Social media interactions are easier and we naturally tend to the lower energy needed activities.


#### Reclaiming Conversation {#reclaiming-conversation}


#### Practices to move toward conversation instead of connection {#practices-to-move-toward-conversation-instead-of-connection}

-   Don’t use the interaction through social media to like or comment. Instead opt for more in person conversations. This will strengthen the relationships you have.
-   Consolidate you text sessions into small bouts of time and set your phone to do not disturb otherwise.
-   Create set times each week where people can reach you or meet with you to have a conversation.
    -   I was particularly interested in the coffee shop option which would allow you to set time where you would always be at a coffee shop during the weekend and start inviting family or friends to meet with you. Bring a book to read as backup.


### Reclaim Leisure {#reclaim-leisure}

-   Stopping all forms of technology can create a minor sense of cold turkey due to the behavioral addictions we have made.
-   Smart phones and tv have become a way for us to avoid having to acknowledge boredom or solitude.
-   Before trying to do any digital minimizing it is important to identify what forms of high quality leisure will take their place.


#### The Bennett Principle {#the-bennett-principle}

-   People who have become financially independent are a great source for determining what meaningful leisure time looks like. One thing that many of them find is that strenuous activity in leisure leaves them feeling more relaxed than passive consumption does.


#### On Craft and Satisfaction {#on-craft-and-satisfaction}

-   When we can learn to apply ourselves to a craft that creates physical outputs in our free time we will be much more content with ourselves and our lives.
-   Digital craft can still work but doesn’t allow us to pour ourselves into something like physical craft does.

Physical lets us leave evidence of ourselves in the physical world.


#### Supercharged Sociality {#supercharged-sociality}

-   Social leisure activities such as board game groups, or fitness groups (F3 or CrossFit)create a social sense of comradarie while also providing a sense of difficulty.


#### The Leisure Renaissance {#the-leisure-renaissance}

-   Digital tools can still be used but need to move to a support role of you high quality leisure time.


#### Practice: Fix or Build something every week {#practice-fix-or-build-something-every-week}

-   From a financial perspective it is most efficient to specialize and the hire out the stuff you don’t know.
-   From a high quality leisure perspective it is more beneficial to learn new skills when you need to fix something.


#### Practice: Schedule low quality leisure {#practice-schedule-low-quality-leisure}

-   Scheduling your low quality leisure time provides the benefit of control over your schedule and control over your skepticism that you have the willpower to abstain from low quality leisure.


#### Practice: Join Something {#practice-join-something}


#### Practice: Follow Leisure Plans {#practice-follow-leisure-plans}

-   Creating a seasonal leisure plan is a bit like personal okrs
-   Weekly leisure planning is more like initiatives in the okr process


### Chapter 7: Join the Attention Resistance {#chapter-7-join-the-attention-resistance}

-   Organizations like Facebook and Google make money off eye ball minutes of our attention and resell that time to advertisers. So the more they can encourage us to spend huge amounts of time on their platforms the more money they are able to make.


#### Practice: Delete social media off your phone {#practice-delete-social-media-off-your-phone}

-   Mobile versions of apps are designed to increase view time off the app. This because mobile is the version that is most accessible by the highest number of people.
-   Often if you remove social media off you phone you will find that you don’t really need it as much as you thought. I certainly have not missed any of the social media I removed from my phone.


#### Practice: Turn you devices into single purpose computers {#practice-turn-you-devices-into-single-purpose-computers}

-   By blocking certain services from you devices during periods of productivity you can increase you focus and thus increase productivity will less functionality.


#### Practice: Use Social media like a professional {#practice-use-social-media-like-a-professional}


#### Practice: Embrace slow media {#practice-embrace-slow-media}

-   Embrace slow access to media to make it more thoughtful. Follow news stories a day after they are breaking. Follow the best sources of writers to find the best content.


#### Practice: Move to a dumb phone {#practice-move-to-a-dumb-phone}

-   With options available like Light Phone it is now much easier to switch even part time to a dumb phone to be more present when you want to be.
