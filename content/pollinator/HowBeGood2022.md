## Notes

-   It is important for fathers to know that stay at home moms feel like they are losing their identity as anything other than a mom
-   It is important for mothers to know that working fathers feel the pressure to provide for their family and how isolated fromr their kids they feel at times
-   Stay at home mothers can feel isolated and lonely
-   With raising a child the "work" is harder to measure and feedback is unclear as opposed to a traditional workplace
    -   Stay at home mothers don't get praise the same way they do at work
-   Mothers can feel that it is hard to be with their children all the time but it is even more difficult to be away from them.
