-   Reading is not a ability that comes from instinctual or genetical factors
-   Deep reading = when we enter a state of reading where we can go beyond the material into our own insights (immersion)
-   What prevents us from deep reading
    -   Distractions
    -   Screens
    -   Skimming
-   Spaces to read deeply
    -   Determine your purpose
    -   Avoid reading on a screen
        -   Reading a screen tends to put us in a skimming mindset
-   Some deep reading cannot be done for long periods of time
-   Embrace your own reading speed
-   When we skim we consolidate less with memory
-   Write down things you want to remember to help you retrieve the memory
