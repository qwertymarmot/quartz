## Notes

We have access to four levels of reading. Elementary Reading allows us to recognize words and their meanings, which is helpful when reading fiction.
[[20240511150708-inspectional_reading|Inspectional Reading]] entails skimming a material for general understanding of what the material is about. This type of reading is helpful when inspecting a material for the first time to understand what you might get from this material and if it is worth your time to read further.
[[20240511160525-analytical_reading|Analytical Reading]] entails reading through the content of a text to better understand the arguments being made. With Analytical reading, we can classify the subject matter of the text and create outlines of the topics and problems that the text addresses.
[[20240511150737-syntopical_reading|Syntopical Reading]] entails taking the information gained from one material and developing it further using other materials to better understand multiple points of view.
