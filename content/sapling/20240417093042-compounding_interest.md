## Notes {#notes}

Compound interest is when you earn interest on both your original money and the interest that gets added over time. So, you make money on your money and the interest too.

Here's the basic idea:

Start with some money (called the principal).
Earn interest on that money.
Add the interest to your principal.
In the next period, you earn interest on the new total (original money + interest).
Repeat this process over time.

Basically, the more often the interest is added and the longer you leave your money, the more it grows.
