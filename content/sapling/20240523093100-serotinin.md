## Notes
-   While serotonin has a complex biological function, it’s popularly known as the molecule of happiness. A variety of antidepressants called Serotonin-Specific Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) work by interfering with the normal reabsorption of serotonin after it’s done with the transmission of the signal, therefore augmenting serotonin levels in the synapses. They don’t work for everyone but show the important role of serotonin when it comes to happiness.
