-   This neurotransmitter plays a major role in motivation and the anticipation of reward. When you achieve a goal, accomplish a task, or hit a target, you receive a pleasurable hit of dopamine. It’s basically your brain telling you that you’ve done a good job. Many types of pleasurable experiences—such as sex, eating, and playing video games—increase dopamine release and therefore make you want to repeat them.
