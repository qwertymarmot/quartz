## Notes
```python
__init__()
```

```python
__repr__()
```

-   Allows us to define a string representation of class so that we can print the class by name and get more than the type and memory location

example:

```python
class Employee():
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def __repr__(self):
    return self.name

argus = Employee("Argus Filch")
print(argus)
# prints "Argus Filch"
```
